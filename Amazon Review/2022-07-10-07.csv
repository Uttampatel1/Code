 I have two of these in an insulated garage.  The garage is large (3 car) and has windows in the west facing garage doors which allows the sun to help warm it in the winter.  I only had one 15 amp circuit servicing the wall outlets in the garage so tapped into an outlet on the opposite interior wall that was on a separate 15 amp circuit and installed an additional outlet.  That lets me run two units in the garage.  I tell Alexa to turn them on about a half hour before I want to go out and work in the garage and by the time I go out the temperature is up to 66 or 67.  We've had temperatures in the upper teens at night but our garage never gets below 50.  I do not leave these units on all the time.  I just turn them on if I'm going to be working in the garage.","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2019",Excellent heat for an insulated garage.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
1,"My daughter lives in my basement, so I needed a heater that would work in about 410 sq feet. I also wanted it to be wall mounted, and the fact that this one worked with wifi was a plus! We've been using this heater for about two weeks, and it's been getting pretty cold at night. This heater has been doing it's job! My daughter loves that she can set a schedule and change the temp from her phone. The remote works fine, but she prefers using her phone because it's so easy and is always with her. We didn't have any trouble at all setting up the wifi or using the app. This is supplemental heat; however, it gets pretty cold in the basement. There is only one heat duct down there, so most of the heat from the forced air furnace goes upstairs. The fact that the heater is up on the wall instead of sitting on a table or the floor means we don't have to worry about it tipping over or items getting pushed up against it. The thermostat seems to be pretty accurate, unlike other heaters we've purchased. It's extremely quiet, and again, being up on the wall helps to heat the space more evenly. So far, this heater is doing a great job and is much better than others we've purchased.","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2019",Great Heater for the Basement,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
2,I’ve been fooling around with several different types of space heaters for my RV to save on the expense of propane and none of them were able to keep up with the demand in colder weather. Additionally it’s difficult to find a heater with a built in thermostat. Well this one has it all. It is efficient. It keeps us very warm and it regulates beautifully. This far I am more than satisfied. I’ve only used it on one trip but do use it regularly as I keep the camper heated Year round. If anything changes I will update but as for now this is the best heater ive used so far and the list is long and expensive of the ones I have tried prior to the Heat Storm.BTW I bought 2. One for the living room and one for the bedroom.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2018",Success!!! RV propane alternative. Love it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: White

4,"Just a heads up, if you do not plan to wall mount this unit and you buy the WiFi model, you will need to purchase the feet from the manufacturer’s website for $9. Otherwise I’m quite pleased so far. Quality is good. Unit is quiet. Heats up fast. WiFi was easy to set up, stays connected and reconnects automatically after power interruption. Will edit this later if for some reason it fails to perform when the temps drop in the next few weeks.Mid winter update : it’s still great. Happy with it and would buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2019",WiFi model does not come with feet.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
5,"The hearer arrived and was dead out of the box. However there was a big sign on it with their customer service number. I called and they sent me a return label as well as shipping out a new unit. The new one works great! I love the idea of being able to hang it on the wall and will probably mount it before next winter. For now, I am using it on the floor. I will only buy infrared heaters. They are economical and cost effective. I have a loft bedroom without a heat source. This heater supplements the heat rising from the floor below to make the loft warm and toasty even on below zero days. I'm glad I took a chance on this brand and will buy from them again.","Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2018",Awesome heater!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: White
6,After a month this heater burned my power outlets. Scorched and brown. Plug was starting to melt. I thought maybe it was the outlet so I had it replaced with one more durable with a higher amperage rating and that one looked scorched as well by the plug. This heater either draws more than 1500 watts OR the cable/plug attached to the heater is not capable of supporting the electrical load to run this heater. This is my 4th Heat Storm as I own 3 of the smaller units ($85/each) that max out at 1000 watts and even those have had random small design issues. I'm completely disappointed because these work so incredibly well and blend in with my home decor. They're supposed to be much safer than a ceramic or forced air heater too.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020",Fire Hazard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi

The included level made it incredibly easy to mount and keep out of reach of our wandering toddler. I will definitely be buying more for the rest of my house!Update: after several months of use, i can now see that my winter electric bills on average have been about 13% than last year using other space heaters, and our home is much more comfortable!

8,"1st of all I have no training in household electric circuits. I am however a retired aircraft technician. I can tell you that a product manufacturer who sold a product thats wiring melted or burned electric receptacles would be sued out of business. So I purchased and installed the wifi unit in the best practical place for my family/TV room which is in my daylight basement and is very difficult to heat with my homes relatively new central heating system. I have 1 small space heater that does not quite do the job. After I installed the Heat Storm heater I realized the electric cord was a foot too short to reach my electric plug behind a designed space I had built for hiding wiring and giving access to electronic repair services. I had a few spare 1 foot 16 awg extension cords,and against the manufacturers warning I connected one. I set the heat storm to 70° f auto, and voila everything seemed great no burned or hot cords. One evening it was a little cooler than usual and the Heat Storm seemed to be struggling to stay on 70°f, I selected high instead of auto. After a few minutes I checked the wiring and just the 1 foot extension was extremely hot. So I unplugged the heat Storm and started digging into the electric requirements of the heater. It requires a minimum 1500 watt electric supply, that an average household circuit can easily handle. The problem was that the 1 foot 16awg extension cord drawing 1500 watts cannot handle this load and is dangerous. To be completely safe factoring in surges you would need a minimum 10 awg rated extension cord, under 10 feet long. This is a little overkill, but considering the manufacturer warning to never connect an extension cord it is warranted. After installing a 10 awg 3 foot extension cord I finished the wifi setup in about 2 minutes, can't explain the difficulty some have reported. Smart Life app is fantastic, easily controls the heater. Works great with Alexa. I highly recommend this heater and by the way, so does Consumers Report recommend a similar heater by this manufacturer, rated #2 in it's class.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021",Fantastic For Size and Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
9,"This thing. This thing right here, is pretty damn good. I hung it up in my 24x15 ft garage immediately after I got home at 830pm on a brisk 47 degree evening. It was 59 degrees in the garage when I turned this bad little beast on. Within 8 minutes, I was up to a somewhat pleasurable 64 degrees. After 8 more minutes, that wonderful temp of 69. It pushes heat like a DOT truck pushing snow: as fast and as much as it can, without out a care in the world. Sitting 12 feet away I can feel it's warm wonderous glory wash over me, kinda like when you bite into a gooey freshly baked cinnamon roll, but better, since it just keeps coming. I think I shall definitely keep this, and name it BOB.

10,"It came with a loose screw inside the unit that I couldn't figure out how to get out.  I left it in there and it's rattling around from the vibration of the unit.  The remote control I received is dead on arrival even after trying different batteries than the ones supplied with.  As for functionality - there's very little you can adjust.  The only things you have control over are the on/off, and up/down of temp.  It'd be nice to be able to turn off the eco mode, dim the glaring light produced by the read out.  Also there's no advanced things such as timer control.  It gets really annoying hearing the eco mode click on and off.  If it comes 1 degree from your set temp eco mode will kick in.  Because less air is being pushed out within a minute the temp will then enter into 2 degrees below your setting and this will go on and on.  There needs to be better programming to avoid this, such as when the temp reaches one degree above your setting it'll then enter eco mode and the temp slowly drops to your setting (or a variation of that)  overall I'm quite disappointed.  This thing should sell for half the price that it is now.  It's built very cheap, not much functionality, and not QC'd from the factory.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2019",Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: White
11,"I see some issues that are mention about melting plugs and fire issues.1. never plug this into a power strip, always plug it directly into a wall.2. I would run this on a 20 amp line, too close to power limits if running on max power for an extended period of time. This wont result in fire this just wont produce the amount of heat you were looking for.3. if your plug is melting in the wall more than likely there is a compatibility issue between you wire coming into the receptacle and the receptacle its self.  example:  A. you're running 20 amp wire on a 15 amp receptacle.This not being the only possibility but more likely the probability. I have run into this issue with oil filled heaters pulling too much power with incompatible wiring and receptacle.But if you run this on a lower heat setting constantly with an occasional burst of high heat there should be no issues.

It keeps my room warm and the room next to mine, the family room. It works wonders. It has helped me save money and stick it to the immoral local city utility. It's a win win!

13,"I have installed this heater in a 24x26 insulated stand alone garage. I have mounted it on the edge of a workbench as shown in the picture. I live in the Appalachian mountains and it can get reasonably cold during our winters. For the last week lows have been in the high teens. Using this heater, set at 52 degrees to prevent freezing, I have maintained a 50 plus degree temperature at all times.The app allows me to remotely check the temperature and the status of the unit. If you are installing the app, follow the manual and it will work just fine. Guy logic didn’t work my first attempt.The pluses for me are ease of use and the fact that I feel comfortable leaving this unattended since it does not seem to get hot enough around the unit for me to worry about any combustion issues.I was really not convinced this would work in my situation, but so far it is performing better than expected.

14,"I had to wait a LONG time for this to become available but was excited by the WIFI connection because I hated forgetting about my old space heater being on or having to run downstairs to turn it off/on. So I debated about getting this for about 8-10 months before finally giving in and purchasing it. I also thought about an electric fireplace heater, baseboard heaters, etc.When I DID decide to get it, the first one arrived dead. So my wife and I had to deal with the hassle of returning it. Having said that, I LOVE the replacement so far.  It heats up my 500 sq foot basement (with no insulation) way faster than my other space heaters. We haven't gotten to peak cold winter months yet though (currently mid-November). So I can't vouch for winter temperatures yet. The lowest temperature on the outside that we've dealt with are about 20-30 degrees F. It gets to about 67-68 degrees within 20-30 minutes from a starting temp. of 58-59.I absolutely love the WIFI connection and that it syncs up with Alexa. You have to be slightly tech savy to get the Smart Life and the Alexa App to work together. I set up a routine with Alexa so when I say, ""Alexa turn on my basement heater,"" it turns on automatically – wherever I can use my Alexa. I can also simply say ""Alexa, turn on my Heatstorm"" and that works too. I just want it to be easy for my wife and house sitters to say something generic other than saying ""Heatstorm."" I can also simply open either app and find my Heatstorm to turn off or on. So if I'm on my way home and want a toasty warm basement, I can do that ahead of time. The vent grill is also not hot to touch – as per advertised. So that's good for my 2-year old and dog.I plan on eventually mounting it but as of now, the legs are in place. I've read reviews that it was hard for them to install the legs, but I've had zero problems. It took maybe 5-10 minutes to install the feet. I'm a DIYer and it seemed pretty intuitive to me.The sound is VERY quiet to me. The other space heaters Ive had were much loader than this. So maybe the people that said theirs is loud are either super sensitive to noises or they might have a defective unit. There's always a ""clicking"" off sound where you can see your lights quickly tick over. But I plan on dedicating a separate electrical line specifically for this unit.I have a schedule setup to startup early on the weekends so it's nice to have the ability to use a schedule. It's like having a remote thermostat and heater in one – like my Nest for my upstairs.I can't say anything to the energy efficiency quite yet but I haven't noticed a dramatic difference in my electric bill yet. Maybe a little higher. But if anyone knows anything about space heaters, there's no such thing as TRUE energy efficient.YEARLY UDATESo after using this for a year I can say we’re still happy with it. We use it all the time. The energy efficiency isnt great though. Our electric bill haa gone up $20-$40 more a month because of its use.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2019",WORTH IT for my home!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi

16,"I'll update this after talking with customer service but here's my initial feedback. The overall appearance of the heater is great, it's one of the most attractive space heaters on the market. The thing that gets me with any product, however, are set up instructions for a model other than the one you've purchased. That what you get here. The problem is the feet. The heat from this blows downwards. Without the feet on my concern would be that it would overheat the carpet. So the first step, naturally, is to install them. The instructions basically gloss over this. After spending 30 minutes playing with the feet and searching for a product set up video, I've given up for now. Yesterday I assembled a boxed lawnmower yet today I can't get feet on a heater. I'll update this later.Add-on review: I've upgraded the rating from 1 to 3. With feet now installed I've used the heater several times and will probably hang onto it. I'll have to leave it to others to evaluate the energy efficiency of this heater. As far as heat output goes, it doesn't generate anymore heat than the $40.00 model it replaces and, as one reviewer complained, does emit a high pitched hum that some might find irritating. But my former heater didn't have a thermostat or remote control so I consider this to be an upgrade. It's definitely an upgrade as far as the design & appearance goes. I'd probably give this product 4 stars but am still irked by the inattention to detail with regard to the instructions that came with it. I know that it's common for manufacturers to bundle several model numbers with common features in the same ""manual"", but in this case the feet had nothing in common with the model shown. With a much time, energy and money as is invested in a product like this it's difficult to comprehend why a manufacturer would be so cheap as to not print dedicated instructions to match the model sold.","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2018","The overall appearance of the heater is great, it's one of the most attractive space heaters ...",3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: White
17,"We are really pleased with this heater so far. Bought for a bathroom as supplemental heating to main house heating. The product looks clean, smart and modern and functions just the same. The Wifi is a must and the main reason i purchased this device. The app allows you to control the heater from the phone but more importantly to schedule the device to turn on and turn off at preset times (like early morning), at your desired temperature, and on your choices of days (like ""work days only"" as an example). The heater works by radiant heat but also has a blower. The blower is not overly loud. There are 3 selectable modes for the blower/heat power: Low, High and Auto. Auto mode operates at full power (100%) until the room (ambient) temperature is within a degree or so of the set (desired) temperature and then it ""throttles down"" to 50% until the room is up to the desired set temperature. High and Low modes simply operate at High (100%) or Low (50%) continually until the desired temperature is achieved and the thermostat turns the product off, the same as a normal HVAC thermostat control. We simply leave it on Auto mode. The display panel is excellent, you can modify the brightness if desired (also from the app!). The current temperature is displayed and you can manually adjust the set level using the + or - keys (it's essentially a touch screen display almost). The new set temperature will flash for a few seconds for you to see (when adjusted) and then the display returns to the ambient temperature as the heater attempts to meet the set level. Both levels (set and ambient) are displayed together on the app so you can see what the room is and what your appliance is trying to get to. I put a new outlet in the bathroom wall and strategically located the outlet at the rear where there is a large cable storage area with a removable storage cover recessed into the rear plastic body of the heater. This way the cord and outlet are not seen when mounted and it is flush to the wall - it looks great this way and looks like it is ""hard-wired"" - i included a photo. Note that the rating is 1500Watts which is approximately 12.5 Amps so take this into account if you have other loads on your circuit for wire and breaker sizing but remember that this is a continuous maximum rating (100% power) and this product is not designed to run at 100% indefinitely (since it is thermostat controlled). Also be aware that any bathroom outlets need to be GFCI (although this device does not have a ground pin - it does not exempt an additional outlet from being a GFCI). As always, you should consult a certified electrician and adhere to all code regulations especially for bathroom, kitchen or similar applications.The only issue encountered was during initial wifi setup. When downloading the Smart Life app the initial app install asked for some generic global settings about locations services and out of an abundance of caution i declined some of them (security / privacy reasons). After 30 minutes of frustration trying to discover the device using the EZ connect method and then the manual AP method i finally realized that one of these settings was preventing the discovery of the heater on my network. I was just about to call the help line. (Under iPhone General Settings>Smart Life>Local Network slider should be ""on"" to ""allow Smart Life to access"". This is not in the App set up or in the product literature. If this is not set to ""on"" the heater will not connect at all. As soon as i changed it to on it became available. Since then the Wifi has been consistent and never dropped once in 2 weeks. When the unit is unplugged from the outlet for a long duration the settings remain and so the unit reconnects automatically without user intervention (in case of power outage). The unit is wall mount only but i believe that feet for floor standing are available for purchase from the seller via Amazon.In summary, this was a great purchase for looks, functionality, convenience and performance.

19,"Infrared heat is not as dry as regular forced air, even though this does blow air, so it makes a good heat source for hot yoga. This slim model fits tight against the wall and can be turned on remotely so you can operate it before going into the room, and check its temperature. For this use case, note these things:1. Better to install it low - 1 or 2 feet above the floor. Heat rises and this seems to be most efficient for heating the whole room. Also, the thermometer control only goes to 99 Fahrenheit, but when it is installed low, temperatures are higher at your standing height (5 degrees difference for us, so 104 degrees).2. It takes 15 - 30 minutes to heat up above 95 degrees in a small room (ours is 10x14). If you set up your room ahead of time to ensure all A/C vents are closed off and the door is closed, you could start this process before you even get home using your phone.3. Seal your room. That means door threshold, windows, basically insulating all crevices/openings.4. Get a separate thermometer and put it at standing height. This tells you more accurately what the effective temperature is. Humidity reading is a bonus.5. Think about where you want hot air blowing. It is more efficient in the center of the room, but you might not want that air blowing at your face.It really works well for us.","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020",Works well for our HOT YOGA room.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi

21,In cold weather living in an RV (5th wheel) if I have to run my propane heaters nonstop I have to spend $50 every 3rd day to refill the propane. That’s just not economically feasible in the long term so I purchased one of these.It sufficiently heats the main area. At 34F outside it maintained 69F inside. At 44F outside it maintains 71F inside.At 34F outside with a 41F temp inside it took 20 minutes of propane use in conjunction with this electric heater to sufficiently warm the interior and then turn off the propane and keep this heater on to maintain 71F inside.At 41F outside it took 1.5 hours to heat the main portion of the RV to 61F without any propane use. After that I used the propane heater for 10 minutes and warmed the main area up to 75F which this electric heater maintained that temp once the propane was turned off.I was never able to get the WIFI app part to work but I hope this review helps.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2019",RV Friendly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi

26,"I purchased this heater to use as supplemental heat in my home office which is a room over the garage. It often gets much colder in here than the rest of the heating zone, requiring me to set the zone heat to 75*+ to make it in the high 60's in here. This is about a 10'X24' space. With the door closed this little space heater brought the temp from 58* to 71* in less than 20 minutes. It is quiet, the front doesn't get hot, the remote works well from across the room, and it is easily portable if I needed to move it. Having a dog and a toddler I also tested if it really would shut off if knocked over, and it does. It actually shut off when I bumped it hard enough to wobble but didn't actually fall over. Hands down this product deserves 5 Stars.But what really has turned me into a Heat Storm customer for all my space heating needs is their customer service.

I contacted the phone number expecting to deal with a phone tree and hoping I would have time to get to an actual human before my next meeting. On the third ring a real person answered. I explained that my new heater was making an annoying sound. She told me she had to transfer me to support - ahh, here is the long hold - Nope. It never even rang. The next thing I heard was another real life human offering assistance. I was shocked - but in a good way. Real support from real people without jumping through hoops? Is this real life?? Well it was. The man I spoke with (and I feel awful I didn't write down his name) was pleasant, personable, and HELPFUL. He walked me through trouble shooting the issue and when he said he created a file and added my notes in case I have an issue again, I actually feel confident that he did. Thank you so much to this gentleman (again so sorry I forgot your name) and to Heat Storm for hiring customer focused technicians and support. Based on this experience I highly recommend this product and company to anyone who needs a space heater!","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2019",Great Product - Amazing Customer Service,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: White
27,"I purchased this to keep my garage warm in winter (NE Oregon, 3,500 ft elevation; so it gets a bit cold). It really does the job. I have one heater in a 2-car garage. For best comfort, I might buy a second, but for the most part, this one heater is doing the job. I really like the fact that it does come with a thermostat that you control via remote. I can set my garage for 62 degrees to keep my car batteries healthy, and 68 degrees when I need to do some work. Absolutely no complaints.To top it off, it was easy to mount on the wall. They give you a cardboard template for drilling the holes, and the template comes with an embedded level - outstanding!","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2020",Really does the job,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
28,"I've had this heater for 3 years now and it's the best heater I can imagine.  Wifi control is flawless and I use voice commands through Google Assistant to toggle the heater on/off or change its temperature.  The Google integration also makes it easy to set up scheduled times to turn on, which I used for a while to warm up the bathroom in the morning so I wouldn't be so reluctant to get out of bed during cold weather.The heater's design is simple but comprehensive: it can be wall-mounted, which is a great option, and it has a panel in the back for storing accessories, the remote control, and any excess length of the AC cable.It's also quite a capable heater, warming up large rooms pretty quickly by itself.  The cats enjoy laying way to close to it, and I do that myself sometimes too!","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2022",Perfect heater for humans and cats,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
29,"Since COVID, we all had to improvise life. Work from home was no different for me. I have a 3 bedroom house and no office space except for the Kitchen - this was not going to work with kids doing home schooling and whatnot. I sectioned off part of my garage, got a thermal curtain and one of these bad-boys and voila! HEAT! It keeps a 12x10 (with a 10 foot ceiling) part of the garage nice and toasty (i have it set to 72).worth adding: I have the garage door ""half-a.."" insulated, and is a bit drafty still. I have the Heater running all time. I thought turning it on early in the morning would help but when its brisk out, it takes it a bit to heat up. This is not a limitation of the heater. this heater is nice","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020",Best thing I bought for my garage,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Wifi
